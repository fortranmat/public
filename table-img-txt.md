# Energy Scenario Data

1. Energy Scenario
Saudi Arabia was the largest oil producer in the world (end of 2013) followed closely by Russian
Federation and US. Although the United States ranks third in terms of oil production, it only ranks
tenth in terms of proven oil reserves. The top oil producing countries in 2013 are given in Table 1.4.
As against the top producing countries (end of 2013), India’s share is 42 million tonnes and share of
total is 1%.
